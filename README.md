`sfd2ufo` — An SFD to UFO converter
===================================

A simple utility to convert FontForge’s SFD files to UFO files. The main
objective is to create UFO files that are usable in a larger UFO based work
flow, and for that existing UFO libraries are used to generate the UFO files.

Depends on FontForge’s Python module, so in reality it is an FontForge to UFO
converter but without using FontForge’s own UFO support. Might grow an
independent SFD reader in the future, but that is currently a low priority.

Might not generally be useful, as features are added only when needed, but bug
reports and feature requests are welcomed.
